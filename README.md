This Folder contains the SD model, and main EMA calculation, and visualization files. 

INSTRUCTIONS: THE FILES CAN BE DOWNLOADED AS A ZIP BY CLICKING ON THE "CLONE OR DOWNLOAD" BUTTON ON THE MAIN PAGE!

File descriptions:
In general, the visualization files contain the output graphs of the EMA simulation. 

DUO_CalculationFile_AssetConnection: EMA calculation file for the connection of the Road, and Lock.

DUO_VisualizationFile_AssetConnection: EMA visualtion file for the connection of the Road, and Lock.

MODEL folder: FinalModelEMA: SD model, both in mdl (VENSIM), and html. To open mdl, please download the model, and open in VENSIM.

GENERAL_CalculationFile_basecase: Calculation file including the most important KPI's for the city, harbour, area, economy, lock, and road without asset intervention. 

GENERAL_VisualizationFile_basecase: Visualization file, including most important graphs for the KPI's of the city, harbour, area, economy, lock, and road without asset intervention. 

GENERAL_CalculationFile_RoadLockIntervention: Calculation file including the most important KPI's for the city, harbour, area, economy, lock, and road wit asset intervention (best policies for the road, and lock). 

GENERAL_VisualizationFile_RoadLockIntervention: Visualization file including most important graphs for the KPI's of the city, harbour, area, economy, lock, and road wit asset intervention (best policies for the road, and lock). 

PATHWAYS_CalculationFile: Calculation file for constructing the adaptation pathways. Road, and Lock intervention policies could be filed in, and outputs for the most important KPI's, for determining the sell-by-date, are calculated. This calculation file contains 1 example of a road, and lock intervention policy in the hard scenario package.
